A small ROM for doing Neo-Riemannian music theory on the Game Boy.

## What is it ?

As I was experimenting with the sound hardware on the Game Boy, I had
the idea to make a small ROM for the Game Boy to explore the Neo-Riemannian
Tonnetz.
If you don't know about Neo-Riemannian theory, there are multiple resources
on the Net about it. Check out ![this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory) or ![this](https://alpof.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/an-introduction-to-neo-riemannian-theory-9/)) for example.

## How can I use it ?

Just download ![the ROM](neoriemannian.gb) in this repo, and run it
on your emulator, or on a flash cart on an actual Game Boy if you have one !
